# Working Shop Website
  - Work In Progress 
  - No CSS applied

- This is a fully functional shopping website that includes basic website functions such as registering and logging in, adding items to cart, and checking out (Not Fully implemented due to not wanting users to fully buy items). These functions are created using PHP as well as SQL Databses, that actively store a user's username and email as well as a hash for the password. The Database also stores any items a user has added to cart and will leave those items in there indefintely until removed. 

- This website also includes advanced functions such as being able to fully add, remove, and edit items through a user friendly UI without having the need to go into the code itself. (See public_html/Project/admin/add_item.php and edit_item.php) These features allow for dynamic change within a website without ever needing to access the raw code. 
  - These features are accessed only by a user that has level 1 privilege access, also known as an admin account. Having the highest level of access, leve 1, allows the admin user to user the features stated above as well as giving other user's admin level privilege and below.
